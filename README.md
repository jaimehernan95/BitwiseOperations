# Bitwise AND Operations in Java 

## Bitwise Operations
### Bitwise operation are used to perform bit manipulation in a number. Bitwise AND operator denoted by “&” symbol simply performs a multiplication operation in binary representation of two given numbers.

### The approach for the problem is we will take a loop starting from 1 till number N which is given as user input and create a nested loop which would also run till “N” and perform bitwise and operation with two numbers. The result will be stored in variable max if it is greater than previous bitwise and operation results.
